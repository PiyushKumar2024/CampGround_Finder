!!the most commom problem during debugging is the caching of node

1.authentication using passport
    1.passport.use(new LocalStrategy(User.authenticate())); 

    tell the passport to use local stratergy local to your system
    username and password validation. and do the auth(come with passport) method on user model

    2.passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());
    passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());

    how the user will be stored and deleted from a session

    3.User.register(user,pw);
    async so use await. set a password hashed to the user obj and we can storein our db

    4.app.use(passport.initialize());
    initialize the passport to use its stratergies

    5.app.use(passport.session());
    enable session login so dont have to re login again and again
    express.session() should be setup first

    6.passport.authenticate('local',{failureFlash:true,failureRedirect:'/login'})
    used to authenticate via local stratergy and failure falsh:true gives flash enabled for falsh
    and failure redirect redirect when failure occurs 

    7.req.isAuthenticated()
    check wether the given user is logged in/authenticated or not

    8.req.user()
    gives the current user

    9. all the passport intialisation should be done before anything

    10.req.logout(callback with err param) 
    do the rest of the work in this

    11.However, due to some recent security improvements in the Passport.js version updates
    (used for authentication in our application), the session now gets cleared
    after a successful login. This causes a problem with our returnTo redirect logic 
    because we store the returnTo route path (i.e., the path where the user should be redirected back after login)
    in the session (req.session.returnTo), which gets cleared after a successful login.
    To resolve this issue, we will use a middleware function to transfer the returnTo value 
    from the session (req.session.returnTo) to the Express.js app res.locals object before the 
    passport.authenticate() function is executed in the /login POST route.
